# Economy

A NeoForge economy mod under development. This release provides the server lifecycle, world storage, durable journal, recovery, and clock foundation; gameplay features are not available yet.

Requires Minecraft **1.21.1**, NeoForge **21.1.252**, and **Java 21**.

## Build and run

Select Java 21 in your environment, then run:

```sh
./gradlew build
./gradlew runClient
./gradlew runServer
```

The mod jar is written to `build/libs/economy-0.1.0.jar`. Development client and server data are kept separately in `run/client` and `run/server`. Use disposable development worlds.

No additional mods are required; SQLite JDBC is bundled. Each world stores its foundation database and identity under `<world>/economy/` and must be owned by a single Minecraft server. Banking, currencies, shops, and trading are not available yet.

## Scheduling configuration

Create `config/economy-scheduling.properties` in the Minecraft instance directory to override settings. Use one `name=value` entry per line and restart the server to apply changes. Missing entries use the defaults below. Invalid values, unknown keys, or unreadable files leave the economy unavailable and log a configuration error. Storage uses one worker and one SQLite connection.

| Setting | Default | Accepted range |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `calculationWorkers` | 2 | 1–16 |
| `storageQueueCapacity` | 256 tasks | 1–4096 |
| `calculationQueueCapacity` | 64 tasks | 1–4096 |
| `callbackBudgetMillis` | 1 ms per tick | 1–10 ms |
| `sqliteLockTimeoutMillis` | 5000 ms | 1–60000 ms |
| `drainSeconds` | 30 s | 1–300 s |

The callback budget limits when the server starts additional callbacks in a tick. A callback that has already started runs to completion. The drain setting controls how long economy waits for its workers to shut down.

## Status and diagnostics

Use `/economy status` to check availability and startup or catch-up progress. The server console and permission-level 2 operators can also run `/economy diagnostics` for storage and journal checkpoints, queue waits, possible stalls, and the most recent failure code. Storage checkpoints reflect the latest completed sample. Economic rates describe observed progress and are shown only when measurable. During shutdown, check the server log for unresolved work.

## Schema upgrades

New worlds initialize automatically. Redesigned worlds with schema 1, 2, or 3 require a validated complete-world backup before upgrading to schema 4. Prepare it while Minecraft is fully stopped:

```sh
./gradlew prepareEconomyUpgrade -PeconomyWorld=/absolute/path/to/world
```

Backups are placed beside the world in `<world-name>-economy-upgrade-backups/`. Then start Minecraft normally. Missing or changed backups prevent upgrades; they do not erase data. The utility refuses a world whose Minecraft or economy ownership lock is held. It does not copy a running world.

## Complete-world backup and restore

Stop Minecraft normally and wait for the log message `Economy complete-world clean shutdown recorded`. Then create a backup:

```sh
./gradlew backupEconomyWorld -PeconomyWorld=/absolute/path/to/world
```

Backups include the world and economy together, with checksums, version/identity information, journal position, and economic checkpoint. They appear under the sibling `<world-name>-economy-upgrade-backups/<backup-id>/` directory.

Restore into a **new, separate directory**:

```sh
./gradlew restoreEconomyWorld -PeconomyBackup=/absolute/path/to/backup-id -PeconomyRestoreDestination=/absolute/path/to/new-world
```

The restore command validates the backup and refuses an existing destination. It preserves the current world; switching to the restored copy is a separate operator action. Current restore support requires a clean schema-4 backup in this mod's supported manifest format. Earlier pre-upgrade snapshots remain preserved, but are not accepted as clean schema-4 restores.

There is no online backup, automatic replacement, or retention/deletion service. Operators own backup storage and retention. Failed restores can leave a hidden staging directory without publishing the destination.

Economy requests become available after startup recovery and required catch-up. Ordinary Minecraft can continue during that work. With an economic system registered, ongoing catch-up processes UTC intervals in chronological order and gates affected writes until current. Sleep and `/time` do not advance economic time. The core ships without gameplay economic systems, and market-scale catch-up performance has yet to be measured.

Legacy economy databases are not imported. Incompatible, corrupt, or mismatched identity data makes the economy unavailable while ordinary Minecraft play can continue. Preserve the files and inspect the logged error rather than deleting them.

Storage requires filesystem support for exclusive file locks, atomic file publication, and directory synchronization. These checks have been exercised on macOS; other platforms have not been runtime-tested.
